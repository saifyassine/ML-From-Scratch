# ML-From-Scratch
In this repository, we will attack the main Machine Learning algorithms: Linear regression, logisti regression(classifiacation), K-means(clustring) and neural network. From scratch that's mean without using any ML framework such as Sicketlearn and Tensorflow etc.
We will use just the Numpy library, wich enable us to deal with matrix and so on. Also, the pandas the Pandas library to deal with the data and Matplotlib to visualize the data and the results.
