# ML-From-Scratch
#### In this repository, we will tackle the main Machine Learning algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression(classifiacation), K-means(clustring) and neural network, from scratch that's mean without using any ML framework such as Scikitlearn or Tensorflow etc.
#### We will just use the Numpy library, which enable us to deal with matrix and so on. Also, the Pandas library to deal with the data, and Matplotlib to visualize the data and the results.
